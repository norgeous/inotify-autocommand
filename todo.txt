proper config.json validation using schema, rules

logfile exists once and contains string
jobs is an array of objects with at least one child
		job child object must contains:
				paths key - array of strings comtaining path characters
				command key - string
		job child object can contains:
				ignores key - array of strings containing path characters
				limit - number of zero or more












after schema do file validation in one code block section:
logfile exists
each path exists and is either a file or dir
